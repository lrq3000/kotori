Kotori - simple speedmeter app
==========

Kotori is a fork of [Speedmeter](https://github.com/flyingrub/SpeedMeter)

The objective of this fork is to update components used in original app and try to solve some bugs.

Currently the UI components are updated with AndroidX and Material Components.

This app keeps the original features:

- The actual, real-time speed
- The time elapsed
- Meters or kilometers (or miles) traveled
- Maximum speed
