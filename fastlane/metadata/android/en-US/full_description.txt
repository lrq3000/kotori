Kotori obtains the GPS data from device sensors.

Currently the data showed is:

<ul>
<li>Current speed</li>
<li>Distance</li>
<li>Average speed</li>
<li>Maximum speed</li>
<li>GPS accuracy</li>
<li>Used and available satellites</li>
<li>And more...</li>
</ul>

Note that Kotori does not require any internet connection but may is necessary to assist the GPS.
This means some data is shared with Google if the device uses Google Play Services.
